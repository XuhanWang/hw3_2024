# Responsive Grid
The “Skip to content link” (the link within the skip class) should have the following styles on all screen sizes
The link is positioned 40px above the top of its parent element (it is hidden by default).
When the link is in focus it is positioned 20px below the top of its parent (so it is visible only when in focus.)


Any element in focus should have a 2px solid border on all sides.
